18:36 Gnuman Hello, I'm having trouble with multi-client with default config. According to the docs, if my client doesn't support SASL, I can just use `PASS mynick@clientid:password`, but it's telling me that my nickname is already in use: https://gist.github.com/mnakama/61af3c7e1c6ac615ce7ab3ae07f6a395

18:38 Gnuman somehow, thelounge.chat is able to login with the PASS method, but I don't know what it's doing differently. I've tried doing `PASS :mypassword`. I tried `PASS :gnuman_test:password`. I tried `PASS mypassword`. I even tried the wrong password, and I don't get any error messages
18:38 Gnuman I mean I get the same exact response from the server whether I put a valid or an invalid password
18:41 Gnuman this is using ergo 2.11.0 on NixOS
18:55 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> Gnuman: i have to go out, i'll take a look in a couple hours
18:56 Gnuman ah, thanks slingamn =)

20:51 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> Gnuman: what client is this btw?
20:51 Gnuman It's a custom client I'm building: https://github.com/mnakama/flexim-go/blob/master/irc-client.go

20:52 Gnuman I'm just puzzling over what the proper PASS authentication is for multi-client. The docs I referred to are here: https://github.com/ergochat/ergo/blob/stable/docs/USERGUIDE.md#account-registration

20:53 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> the thing you're doing in the transcript looks correct to me
20:53 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> it's PASS account@clientid:password
20:53 Gnuman now, my PASS authentication works for ZNC and etc., but I'm not even getting a response from ergochat
20:53 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> are you sure you entered the password correctly?
20:53 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> also yeah we don't send a response for an incorrect password
20:53 Gnuman hmm...... maybe it's the wrong password, then
20:54 Gnuman I wonder why it's working for thelounge when I don't even put the account@clientid part, just password
20:54 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> TL supports SASL
20:54 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> so it's probably just doing SASL...you could look at the raw log to confirm
20:54 Gnuman yeah, but I didn't enable SASL, just PASS (testing with non-TLS ergochat setup)
20:55 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> if you try to send an account password with PASS and no account: prefix, it will not work
20:55 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> but yeah if you want to confirm what's actually happening, you need the raw log, either from TL's side or the ergo side
20:56 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> jfyi i would recommend upgrading to https://github.com/ergochat/ergo/releases/tag/v2.11.1 but it's not urgent and it won't affect the issue you're currently having
20:56 ErgoBridge <E​rgoBot> Release v2.11.1 · ergochat/ergo · GitHub
20:57 Gnuman ok, how do I configure ergo to log the raw?
21:02 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> find the logging section of your config
21:03 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> change "type" to "*" and "level" to "debug"
21:03 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> but be warned that this will log all traffic, including passwords
21:40 Gnuman thanks slingamn. apologies for going quiet. had a late-night zoom
21:44 ErgoBridge <s​lingamn> np
